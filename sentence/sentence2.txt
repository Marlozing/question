The famous primatologist Frans de Waal, of Emory
University, says humans downplay similarities between us and
other animals as a way of maintaining our spot at the top of our imaginary ladder. Scientists, de Waal points out, can be some of the worst offenders — employing technical language to distance the other animals from us. They call “kissing”
in chimps “mouth-to-mouth contact”; they call “friends”
between primates “favorite affiliation partners”; they interpret
evidence showing that crows and chimps can make tools as being somehow qualitatively different from the kind of
toolmaking said to define humanity. If an animal can beat us at a cognitive task — like how certain bird species can remember
the precise locations of thousands of seeds — they write it off as instinct, not intelligence. This and so many more tricks of
language are what de Waal has termed “linguistic castration.”
The way we use our tongues to disempower animals, the way we invent words to maintain our spot at the top.
