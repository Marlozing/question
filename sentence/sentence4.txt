For many people, ability refers to intellectual competence, so they want everything they do to reflect how smart they are — writing a brilliant legal brief, getting the highest grade on a test, writing elegant computer code, saying something
exceptionally wise or witty in a conversation. You could also
define ability in terms of a particular skill or talent, such as how well one plays the piano, learns a language, or serves a tennis ball. Some people focus on their ability to be
attractive, entertaining, up on the latest trends, or to have the
newest gadgets. However ability may be defined, a problem occurs when it is the sole determinant of one’s self-worth. The performance becomes the only measure of the person;
nothing else is taken into account. An outstanding performance means an outstanding person; an average performance means an average perso, Period.
