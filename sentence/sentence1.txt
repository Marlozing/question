Many people are terrified to fly in airplanes. Often, this fear
stems from a lack of control. The pilot is in control, not the
passengers, and this lack of control instills fear. Many potential
passengers are so afraid they choose to drive great distances
to get to a destination instead of flying. But their decision to
drive is based solely on emotion, not logic. Logic says that
statistically, the odds of dying in a car crash are around 1 in
5,000, while the odds of dying in a plane crash are closer to 1
in 11 million. If you’re going to take a risk, especially one that
could possibly involve your well-being, wouldn’t you want the
odds in your favor? However, most people choose the option
that will cause them the least amount of anxiety. Pay
attention to the thoughts you have about taking the risk and
make sure you’re basing your decision on facts, not just
feelings.
