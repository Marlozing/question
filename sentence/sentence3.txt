A key to engagement and achievement is providing students
with relevant texts they will be interested in. My scholarly
work and my teaching have been deeply influenced by the
work of Rosalie Fink. She interviewed twelve adults who were highly successful in their work, including a physicist, a biochemist, and a company CEO. All of them had dyslexia and
had had significant problems with reading throughout their
school years. While she expected to find that they had avoided
reading and discovered ways to bypass it or compensate with
other strategies for learning, she found the opposite. “To my
surprise, I found that these dyslexics were enthusiastic
readers...they rarely avoided reading. On the contrary, they
sought out books.” The pattern Fink discovered was that all of
her subjects had been passionate in some personal interest.
The areas of interest included religion, math, business,
science, history, and biography. What mattered was that they
read voraciously to find out more.
